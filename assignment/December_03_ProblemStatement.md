## Problem Statement 1:

Create a `PlayerCharacter` and a `NonPlayerCharacter` with a common ancestor `Character`. The characters are located in a `10x10` game field. All characters appear at a random location. Create the three classes, and make sure you can query where each character is.

```javascript
class Character {
    constructor( id, name, x, y ) {
       // Write your code here
    }

    get position() {
        // Write your code here
    }
}

// Define Player Character and NonPlayerCharacter classes here

function createPlayer(id, name) {
    // Write your code here
}

function createNonPlayer(id, name) {
    // Write your code here
}
```
